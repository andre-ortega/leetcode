Leetcode problems can be boiled down to basic patterns that lead us to the fastest way to solve the problems

1. Sliding Window
        - Used when we want to perate on a specific window size of a linked list/array
        - Window slides from the start to the end of the array
        - Traverses one element at a time

        - Basically checking the subsets of the subarray to solve a problem
        - Only useful for contiguous data structures, like arrays/Linked Lists
        - Sliding window probably won't work if related elements are not next to each other 

        Example Problems:
            - Max Sum
            - Subarray of size K 
            - Longest substring of size K with distinct characters
            - String anagrams

        Detailed Problem:

            Given an array of integers arr and two integers k and threshold, return the number of 
            sub-arrays of size k and average greater than or equal to threshold

            Solution Pseudocode:

                1. Find the sum of the first k ints
                2. Add to counter if the average of sum over k is equal to or greater than the threshold
                3. For the rest of the array
                    a. Slide window up by one element
                    b. Calculate the average of these k elements
                    c. If the k element's average is greater than the threshold, add to the counter
                4. Return counter

                [Answer is in slidingWindow.cpp]

2. Two Pointers or Iterators

    - Two pointers iterate through a data structure at the same time
    - Iterate until a certain condition is met
    - Alternative to looping through structure twice
    - Useful when searching pairs in a sorted array

    - How to identify:
        - Sorted array / linked list
        - Need t find elements that fit a certain condition
        - Set that we need to find is a pair/triplet/subarray

    - An example problem is finding out if a sorted array contains two numbers that can find a target sum
        - Left pointer will be the smaller number
        - Right pointer will be the larger number

    Example Problems:
        - Squaring a sorted array
        - Triplets that sum to zero
        - Comparing strings that contain backspaces

    Detailed Problem:

        You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two 
        endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

        Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the 
        most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

        Two Pointers Pseudocode:
            1. Start at the beginning and end of the array
            2. While the two pointers don't intersect
                a. Find the minimum height
                b. Find the width
                c. Find the area
                d. If the area is larger than the current max, update it
                e. Increment or decrement the pointer that has the smaller height


3. Fast and Slow Pointers
4. Merge intervals
5. Cyclic Sort
6. In-Place Reversal of Linked List
7. Tree BFS
8. Tree DFS
9. Two Heaps
10. Subsets
11. Modified Binary Search
12. Top K Elements
13. K-Way Merge
14. Topological Sort

All of these patterns can prevent us from doing the Brute-Force solution
Knowing what to look for will make Leetcode much easier
